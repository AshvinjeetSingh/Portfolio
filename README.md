## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.

Iâ€™m proud of my open-source site and the hard work that went into building and designing it. While I love sharing my work with the community, it's disheartening to see it copied without credit. Plagiarism is discouraging and unfair. Please, if you use my site, give credit where itâ€™s due. Let's respect and appreciate each other's efforts!


### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [ashvinjeet.dev](https://ashvinjeet.dev). Thanks!
